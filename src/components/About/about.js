        <span className="aboutDesc">I am an enthusiastic designer with a solid grasp of user-centric design concepts and experience working with a range of technologies and development tools. I'm also highly interested in cybersecurity and I always try to learn more about it. I have the thirst for knowledge, the required skill set, and the professional background to go deeply into the area of creating user-enjoyable and industry useful applications. I always try to maintain positive connections with those around me and I am a team player with good communication skills. Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including painting, drawing, cycling, listening to music, traveling, and playing badminton.Â </span>
