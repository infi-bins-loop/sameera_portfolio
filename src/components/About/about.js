        <span className="aboutDesc" >I am an enthusiastic designer based in Bengaluru, India. I have been developing my design skills for over a year and have gained a solid understanding of user-centric design concepts. I have experience working with a range of technologies and development tools, and I am also highly interested in cybersecurity and always curious to learn more about it. I have a thirst for knowledge, the required skill set, and the professional background to delve deeply into the area of creating user-enjoyable and industry-useful applications. I always strive to maintain positive relationships with those around me, and I am a team player with excellent communication skills. Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, such as painting, drawing, cycling, listening to music, traveling, and playing badminton.Â </span>
